# curltorequests
crappy code to parse headers from curl request and do simple canned request against instagram api

This code is fairly abysmal and not very automated but if you have a curl request that works against instagram api (and hopefully in general) you should be able to grab a response

Curl requests that can work against websites can be massaged out of programs such as Charles Proxy https://www.charlesproxy.com/

This likely won't do anything very clever with cookies or redirects and is untested for that, but it is working for some basic cases

TODO parse the url to visit instead of hard-coding it.  Take a closer look at cookies.


DEPRECATION NOTICE - use tools from instaburglar instead
